### assets

The assets directory contains support materials for the workshop. I'm treating the assets folder as a place to collect everything that isn't data, reports, or scripts. 

- files for participants to download (collected in one folder) 
- non-data images, such as screen-shots or logos 

and support materials for the website

- css themes used by the web pages
