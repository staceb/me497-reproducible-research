- Describe the problems that reproducibility helps solve 
- Identify non-reproducible practices in their current workflow 
- List the basic principles of reproducible research 
- Organize a project directory for reproducibility

The workshop entails two 3-hour sessions. Participants follow a self-paced tutorial to create a sample report, then create a reproducible report of their own research. We treat the following commonly-encountered aspects of technical writing: 

- reading, manipulating, and analyzing data 
- creating tables and graphs 
- writing equations and in-line results 
- managing headings, references, and external media
