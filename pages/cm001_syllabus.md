### me497/me597 reproducible research 

We explore the principles and practices of reproducible research, from gathering data to analyzing data and presenting results. Students implement a  workflow to create dynamically reproducible technical reports. 




We implement a  reproducible workflow by creating dynamically reproducible technical reports

by learning to organize a technical project for reproducibility from the beginning of the project and to explicitly link the files for computing, results, and narrative. The course takes you through an entire reproducible research workflow. Our software environment is R & RStudio---no prior experience required. The course is open to all majors (a mechanical engineering background is not required). 

4R-0L-4C (4 hours lecture/week, 0 lab, 4 credit hours)


### prerequisites

497: Junior standing    
597: Instructor permission required. Graduate students only with a project underway generating quantitative data.

### objectives

After successfully completing this course, students should be able to:

- Identify non-reproducible practices in a conventional workflow 
- Describe the problems that reproducibility helps solve 
- List the basic principles of reproducible research 
- Organize directories and files for reproducibility 
- Create reproducible reports using R and RStudio 
- Reproduce someone else's reproducible project 
- Use GitHub for version control 
 
### grades

The four major deliverables and their weights are: 

- (10%) Recreating the calibration report example 
- (25%) Recreating one's own report (prior work) in reproducible form 
- (40%) Major term project in data gathering, analysis, and reporting 
- (25%) Reproducing someone else's project and critiquing the work 

Grades awarded are based on the Institute [standards](www.rose-hulman.edu/offices-services/registrar/rules-procedures/grades.aspx), for example, an "A" is an *honor grade*, a "B" is awarded for *thorough competence*, and a "C" indicates that*minimum standards have been met*.
