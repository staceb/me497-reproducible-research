### pages

The pages/ directory contains Markdown files that will become html pages on the site.

If I use an Rmd file to create the md page, make sure to run render the Rmd file from the runall.R script (like I did for the agenda) to get the correct page header auto-generated. 

Note that when linking to any of these Markdown-based pages, use a .html extension rather than .md, for example

`[Tutorial](pages/tutorial.html)`
