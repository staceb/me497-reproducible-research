# Plan the data reshaping

For analysis, the data set should be in tidy (long) form, with every column a variable and every row an observation. The tidy form will have these variable names:

- observ (observation number)
- cycle (cycle number)
- test\_pt (test point number and direction)
- input\_lb (applied reference force)
- output\_mV (sensor readings)

In the reshaped data set, every mV reading will appear in its own row identified by cycle number (from the existing column name) and test point.  Thus the columns with *cycle* in their name  are the ones being gathered. 

```{r 02-03}
# active data set
data_received <- read_csv('data/01_calibr_data_active-report.csv')
# extract the indices of the column names that include "cycle"
all_col_names <- colnames(data_received)
# TF detection
detect_cycle_col <- str_detect(tolower(all_col_names), 'cycle')
# extract indices of TRUE
is_a_cycle_col <- which(detect_cycle_col)
# examine
is_a_cycle_col
```

# Reshape the data to long form

```{r 02-04}
# gather the columns of mV readings
long_data <- data_received %>%
	gather(cycle, output_mV, is_a_cycle_col) 

# examine its structure
glimpse(long_data) 

# examine the summary statistics of each column
summary(long_data) 
```

I have the columns I expected.

All the NA values are in the mV readings column and can be safely deleted because they represent readings never taken (per the ANSI/ISA standard). 

Result is the first tidy form, where every row is an observation and every column a variable.  

```{r 02-05}
# omit NAs
tidy_data <- long_data %>%
	filter(!output_mV %in% NA)

# examine
glimpse(tidy_data)
```

# Add observation numbers

The test points are in the order in which the data were acquired (consistent with the ANSI/ISA standard). So the observation number is the same as the row number. 

```{r 02-06}
# observation number is a sequence of integers, from 1 to the number of rows
nrow_in_tidy_data <- nrow(tidy_data)
tidy_data <- tidy_data %>%
	mutate(observ = 1:nrow_in_tidy_data)

# examine
head(tidy_data, n = 3L) 
```

# Simplify the cycle number

The `cycle` data are strings, *cycle_1*, *cycle_2*, etc., from the original column headings. It might be useful to replace these strings with integers, e.g. `<int> 1` for `<chr> cycle_1`. 

```{r 02-07}
# separate cycle character, convert numerals to integers
tidy_data  <- tidy_data %>%
	separate(cycle, into = c('prefix', 'cycle'), sep = '_', convert = TRUE)

# examine the separated columns
head(tidy_data, n = 3)
```

The `prefix` column is superfluous. 

```{r 02-08}
tidy_data <- tidy_data %>%
	select(-prefix)

# examine
glimpse(tidy_data)
```

# Final touches 

The last steps in tidying this data set are to rearrange columns in a logical order and shorten the `test_point` variable name. It's a small enough data set that I can print it. 

```{r 02-09}
tidy_data <- tidy_data %>%
	select(observ, cycle, test_pt = test_point, input_lb, output_mV)

print(tidy_data)
```

This data set is now ready to use as source data for graphs and analysis; we write it to the `data ` directory. 

```{r 02-10}
write_csv(tidy_data, "data/02_calibr_data-tidy.csv")
```
