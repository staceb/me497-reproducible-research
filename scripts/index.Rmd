We explore the principles and practices of reproducible research, from gathering data to analyzing data and presenting results. Students implement a  workflow that includes file management, version control, literate programming, data carpentry, creating tables and graphs, and reporting---all within the context of producing reproducible technical reports.

### books I recommend

- [*R in Action, 2/e*](https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-second-edition) by Robert Kabacoff, 2015, Manning Publications. If you want to buy just one good reference for R, this is the one I recommend. It covers R basics including statistical analysis and graphics. 
- [*R Graphics, 2/e*](https://www.crcpress.com/R-Graphics-Second-Edition/Murrell/p/book/9781439831762) by Paul Murrell, 2011, CRC Press. This is the book for learning about the four major R graphics systems (`base, grid, lattice, ggplot2`).  The author's [book website](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/RG2e/) has the code for every figure in the book.
