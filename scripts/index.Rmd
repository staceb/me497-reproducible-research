The main goal of the course is to help you establish a habitual  *workflow* that "weaves the principles of reproducibility throughout your entire research project, from data gathering to the statistical analysis, and the presentation of results" [@Gandrud2015]. 

Our software tools include R, RStudio, R Markdown, Git, and GitHub.
