## Welcome

<br>Trying to practice what I preach, course materials are reproducible. 

<br>https://dsr-rhit.github.io/me497-reproducible-research/ 



  



## Getting started

<br>Introductions  
Handouts

<br>Write down your ideas in response to Mystery question 1: 

<br><p style="text-align:center; color:#6566AE;">
<span class="fragment fade-down">
*What is reproducible research?*

<p style="color:#6566AE">Research is reproducible when the data and the code used to obtain a finding are available and sufficient for an independent researcher to recreate the finding.</p>

<br>

- computational, data-intensive

- spans the full data, analysis, & publication workflow

- most of us have received only perfunctory training (if any)

<h2>Events tell us:</h2>  

<br>

More accountability is needed because of    

- data falsification 
- erroneous analysis 
- misleading presentation of results

## Steps to take towards reproducibility

<div id="left55">

- Write scripts (avoid manual copy, paste, mouse-clicks)

- Plan the organization and naming scheme for files 

- Strive for simplicity, readability, reusability, and testability

- Agree on a workflow for collaborating before starting a manuscript

</div>

<div id="right40">

- DRY (don't repeat yourself)

- Link files explicitly

- Plan data management 

- Use version control 

- Postpone optimization

- License your software

</div>
