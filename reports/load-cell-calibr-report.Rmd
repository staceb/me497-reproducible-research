## Introduction

Calibrating a *load cell* (a sensor for measuring uniaxial force) yields two main results: a calibration equation relating output voltage (mV) to input force (lb); and an estimate of sensor accuracy as a percentage of full span. This report presents the test results for an Omega LCL-005 load cell calibrated following the ANSI/ISA procedure.

The load-cell setup is shown in Figure 1. A known weight is suspended from the eye-hook, causing the thin-beam load cell to deform. A Wheatstone bridge on the beam detects the deformation and produces a voltage output signal that is  recorded.

```{r read-data}
# a package for fast and easy file reading
library(readr)

# assign the CSV data to a variable for further manipulation
calibr_data <- read_csv('data/load-cell-calibr-L3.csv')
```

The calibration data are shown in Table 1. These data comprise `r nrow(calibr_data)` observations over `r max(calibr_data$cycle)` up-down cycles. Per the ANSI standard, the test begins and ends at the same mid-cycle test point in the same direction. 

```{r print-table, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE, results='asis'}
