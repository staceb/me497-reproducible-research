### me497/me597 reproducible research

We explore the practice and principles of reproducible research by learning to organize a technical project for reproducibility from the beginning of the project and to explicitly link the files for computing, results, and narrative. The course takes you through an entire reproducible research workflow. Our software environment is R & RStudio---no prior experience required. The course is open to all majors (a mechanical engineering background is not required).
