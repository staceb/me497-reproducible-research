### me497-reproducible-research

In this course, we explore the practices and principles of reproducible research by learning to organize a technical project for reproducibility from the beginning of the project and to explicitly link the files for computing, results, and narrative. The course takes you through an entire reproducible research workflow. Our software environment is R and RStudio---no prior experience required.
